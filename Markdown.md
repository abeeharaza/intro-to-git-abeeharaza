# Intro to Git
## What I have learned in this course:
- Forking repositories
- Formatting markdown files
- adding gifs/images to the markdown files
- creating a new file in a repository
## What I still have questions on:
* Are forks and branches the same thing?
* Am I creating a markdown file the right way?
* Are my changes being committed?
